2. Click OK and the software will be installed by itself. After installation, restart the Arduino IDE software.

3. Paste everything in the lib folder into the `\Documents\Arduino\libraries `directory. The TFT driver model is ST7789. The annotated information in the file is the TFT_eSPI library pin number. No modification is required if the TFT_eSPI provided in the lib is used. Other libraries can refer to pins for configuration.
